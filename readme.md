# 5bx
5BX is a way to track a simple workout.

Influenced by the 5BX system created in the 1950s by Dr. Bill Orban, and The Hacker's Diet by John Walker, although this project claims no affiliation with either.

This application is built with Express and Bulma.

## Building the application
```bash
npm install
npm run css
npm start
```
